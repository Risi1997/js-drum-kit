Learning JavaScript by building things.
I have taken the Javascript 30 days challeneg and this is the first day and my first project on this challenge.
You can take this challenge from here https://javascript30.com/. The content is awesome and free. The creator of the challenge is Wes Bos ðŸ‘‰ https://wesbos.com/. The mantra is to learn by doing things. 
Give it Try! Happy Coding.
